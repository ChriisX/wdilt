# What did I learn tonight? :moon:
WDILT (short for What did I learn tonight) is a repository where I'm going to detail everything I learn every night.

Its purpose is not only to write down what I've learned, but also to force me to learn everyday, even when my motivation is really low!

## Topics
Stuffs I want to learn have to be related as much as possible to my dream career (which is software engineer), but everything about development (in general), project management or even job advices is good to know.

Hopefully, you'll learn new things too!

This first night is about Markdown.

How do you want me to write a good readme without knowing that much about markdown?

As it would take to much space here, you can go to my [test file](https://github.com/ChriisX/wdilt/blob/master/resources/markdown/tests.md).

Tonight I learned the bases of building a chrome extension.

I used [this](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted) resource, which aims to create a first extension that changes the background color of the chrome developer website.

Also, I'll soon create a repository that will hold a chrome extension for viewing the time spent navigating everyday.

(It's been a while since I last posted because I had a lot of work for school)

This night and the previous one have been about Vue.JS, which I'll be using in a few days at my internship.

I've created a little repository where I post all my tests: [vue-training](https://github.com/ChriisX/vue-training). I will try to keep it up to dateas much as possible.
