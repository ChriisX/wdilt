Tonight I learned the bases of building a chrome extension.

I used [this](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted) resource, which aims to create a first extension that changes the background color of the chrome developer website.

Also, I'll soon create a repository that will hold a chrome extension for viewing the time spent navigating everyday.
