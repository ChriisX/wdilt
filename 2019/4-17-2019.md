(It's been a while since I last posted because I had a lot of work for school)

This night and the previous one have been about Vue.JS, which I'll be using in a few days at my internship.

I've created a little repository where I post all my tests: [vue-training](https://github.com/ChriisX/vue-training). I will try to keep it up to dateas much as possible.
